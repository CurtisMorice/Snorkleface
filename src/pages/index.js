        <h2> About Curtis </h2> <p> Hi you beautiful person you! </p>
        <p>

          I am just your typical everyday, outgoing, happy, middle - aged, bald,
          little - chunky, animal - father, tech - wannabe, man. Living life to
          the fullest with a smile on my face.You can either catch me in front
          of my computer, walking my dog, yogaing / working - out, or walking my
          dog some more. I am truly grateful for the people and animal(s) I have
          in my life.I am grateful that I have a place to sleep, food, and
          friendships. I try not to have expectations on anything and I tend to
          not take things too seriously because in my perspective all of my
          problems are very 1 st world.
        </p>
        <p>

          I have lived in St.Louis, Missouri; Branson, Missouri; Minneapolis &
          St.Paul, Minnesota, and Annecy - le - Vieux, France.I love languages
          and currently speak French, Spanish, some Chinese, Swedish, German and
          a little English. I love playing with computers, coding and learning
          new technologies.I am currently teaching myself the c#.Net combo as a
          side project as well as keeping up to date on whats new with as much
          as I can but nobody has that much time. I currently work in
          JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Liquid, BackBone.js, Bind2, Node.js,
          Cordova, Puppeteer, Raspberry - pi, AWS Apache, Sqlite, X - Code,
          Android Studio, and of course jQuery, Underscore, SCSS / CSS and
          HTML5.I also know React, React - Native, Angular, PHP, Liquid and I
          dabbled in Java about 10 years ago.I have built out sites using
          Wordpress.org and Shopify.I am always looking for opportunities to
          learn more and learn from other people so if you have time to play
          code please feel free to contact me.

        <h2> Career History </h2>
        <p>

          I have had a few careers over the past 20 years and I never truly felt
          at like I was making one until I started coding I remember going to
          one of my first JavaScript meet - ups and in the middle of hearing the
          main speaker I knew this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my
          working life.
        </p>
        <p>

          Starting off in my teens I worked for a Retreat / Renewal center in
          Florissant, Missouri called

          . I was 13 and I would wash dishes and stock soda machines on the
          weekends for basball card money.I dont remember how long I worked
          there but I do remember I was making $3 .80 an hour!! I know,
          right.Almost baller status.When I was 16 I got a job in a fast - food
          place called "Steak Out" and worked prepping salads, to - go kits, and
          baked potatoes plus answered phones. Soo much excitement.

          I ended up moving to Branson, Missouri a year and a half later and
          while I was there I worked in the

          as a stage - "left" technician and at the St.Louis Bread Comapny which
          is now called Panera Bread Co.(little fun fact).I soon went off to
          college at South West Missouri State and then quit college and worked
          telemarketing for At&T to save money so I could move to France.

          I moved to France in February of 1997 and ended up liveing there off
