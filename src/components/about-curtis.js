        <h2> About Curtis </h2> <p> Hi you beautiful person you! </p>
        <p>
          I am just your typical everyday, outgoing, happy, middle - aged, bald,
          little - chunky, animal - father, tech - wannabe, man. Living life to
          the fullest with a smile on my face.You can either catch me in front
          of my computer, walking my dog, yogaing / working - out, or walking my
          dog some more. I am truly grateful for the people and animal(s) I have
          in my life.I am grateful that I have a place to sleep, food, and
          friendships. I try not to have expectations on anything and I tend to
          not take things too seriously because in my perspective all of my
          problems are very 1st world.

          I have lived in St. Louis, Missouri; Branson, Missouri; Minneapolis &
          St. Paul, Minnesota, and Annecy-le-Vieux, France.I love languages and
          currently speak French, Spanish, some Chinese, Swedish, German and a
          little English. I love playing with computers, coding and learning new
          technologies.I am currently teaching myself the c#.Net combo as a side
          project as well as keeping up to date on whats new with as much as I
          can but nobody has that much time. I currently work in JavaScript,
          Ruby on Rails, Liquid, BackBone.js, Bind2, Node.js, Cordova,
          Puppeteer, Raspberry - pi, AWS Apache, Sqlite, X - Code, Android
          Studio, and of course jQuery, Underscore, SCSS / CSS and HTML5.I also
          know React, React - Native, Angular, PHP, Liquid and I dabbled in Java
          about 10 years ago.I have built out sites using Wordpress.org,
          Gatsbyjs and Shopify.I am always looking for opportunities to learn
          more and learn from other people so if you have time to play code
          please feel free to contact me.
