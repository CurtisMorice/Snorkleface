          I have had a few careers over the past 20 years and I never truly felt
          at like I was making one until I started coding I remember going to
          one of my first JavaScript meet - ups and in the middle of hearing the
          main speaker I knew this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my
          working life.

          . I was 13 and I would wash dishes and stock soda machines on the
          weekends for baseball card money.I dont remember how long I worked
          there but I do remember I was making $3 .80 an hour!! I know,
          right.Almost baller status.When I was 16 I got a job in a fast - food
          place called "Steak Out" and worked prepping salads, to - go kits, and
          baked potatoes plus answered phones. Soo much excitement.

          telemarketing for At&T to save money so I could move to France.
